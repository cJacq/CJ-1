# CJ-1
one of my first relational database designs

and my first public git file :)

This database was created as part of our final capstone project at Tech Elevator - December 2021 

  Team members
  - Cecilia (me)
  - Nate 
  - Essence 
  - Aaron 
  - Kris 
 
With a starter schema (and excellent coaching) provided by Tech Elevator, and valued assistance from Kris and Aaron, I designed and built this database 
 
During January 2022 I updated table and column names for consistency, and, after some testing and re-editing, it compiled. 
Nothing like that feeling when the code works :)

Now to editing JDBC files to align
